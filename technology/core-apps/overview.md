**The** [**Overview**](https://www.unit.network/token/UNIT) **module publicly displays key administration and financial information based on the **_**current**_** statistics and metrics of a token.**&#x20;

* **Manager:** The account that created and administers the token
* **Manager Last Active:** Time since last login&#x20;
* **Date:** Date and time the token was created
* **Supply:** Total amount of tokens created (this can only be changed if the token manager has possession of all tokens).
* **Circulating Supply:** Total amount of tokens that have been sold or transferred out of the token bank to other wallets or users.
* **Market Valuation (Diluted):** The total token supply multiplied by the exchange price
* **Market Valuation (Circulating):** The circulating token supply multiplied by the exchange price
* **Treasury:** Current value of the cryptocurrencies locked into the treasury
* **Floor Price:** Current value of the treasury divided by the total token supply
* **Exchange Price:** Current exchange price of the token&#x20;
* **Pool Value:** Current value staked into the exchange pools

Much of this information can be found on websites like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) for established cryptocurrencies and tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. but listing small-cap or niche tokens created on Unit Network is not possible in the short term, hence a strong emphasis on providing this info to all users and token creators.
