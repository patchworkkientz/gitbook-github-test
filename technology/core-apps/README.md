**The** [**Info**](https://www.unit.network/token/UNIT) **tab is the public dashboard of a token showing a financial overview,  community leaderboard, invite tab, team, advisors and updates.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
All of the information shown on the [info](https://www.unit.network/token/UNIT) tab is public, visible to any user on the platform
{% endhint %}

With a snapshot of key financial and community metrics, any user is able to determine the health and/or legitimacy of the token based on information like:

* Treasury holdings
* Date created
* Token Manager
* Pool Value
* Circulating Supply
* Team & Community Size
* Time Last Active

This is data that can be difficult to find or calculate on tokens created outside of the Unit Network ecosystem as the information is not usually laid-out (transparently) on a single dashboard. Our aim with the info tab is bring the most important token information to a single place.&#x20;

Next, we'll take a closer look at the overview module.
