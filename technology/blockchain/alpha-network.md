# ðŸ”— Alpha Network

## Overview

Alpha Network is the canary network of [Unit Network](../../overview/unit-network/vision.md). As a canary network, Alpha Network operates parallel to the main network and serves as a testing ground for new blockchain technologies and protocols before they are implemented on Unit Network.

Alpha Network is launching on the Kusama relaychain, which is known for its scalability and ability to support multiple chains. The combination of the Unit Network platform and the Kusama relaychain provides a powerful and flexible infrastructure for blockchain developers to test and launch new applications.

## Use:

**As the canary network of Unit Network, Alpha Network provides several benefits and use cases, including:**

1. **Testing new blockchain technologies:** Alpha Network is designed to be a safe and secure testing ground for new blockchain technologies and protocols. Developers can experiment with new features and functionalities without risking the security or stability of the larger network.
2. **Launching new blockchain applications:** Alpha Network provides a decentralised and secure platform for developers to launch new blockchain applications and smart contracts. The network supports a wide range of use cases, from decentralised finance (DeFi) and gaming to supply chain management and identity verification.
3. **Accelerating innovation:** By providing a dedicated canary network for testing and experimentation, Alpha Network helps to accelerate innovation in the blockchain space. Developers can iterate more quickly and efficiently, leading to faster progress and breakthroughs in the technology.
4. **Community building:** Alpha Network also provides a platform for building and fostering a strong community of blockchain developers and enthusiasts. The network encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, helping to grow and strengthen the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

## Timeline 2023:

#### February: Preparation and planning

* Alpha Network team researches and prepares their parachain bid for Kusama's next parachain slot auction.
* The team outlines the technical requirements for launching Alpha Network on Kusama, including the necessary smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and node infrastructure.

#### March: Parachain auction bidding

* Alpha Network team participates in the Kusama parachain slot auction and bids for a slot on the Kusama network.
* The team communicates with the Kusama community and potential supporters to generate interest and support for their bid.

#### April: Parachain slot allocation and setup

* Alpha Network team successfully wins a parachain slot on the Kusama network.
* The team sets up the Alpha Network parachain on Kusama, including node infrastructure, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms.
* The team conducts thorough testing of the Alpha Network parachain to ensure it is ready for launch.

#### May: Security and auditing

* The Alpha Network team conducts a security audit of their parachain to ensure it is secure and free of vulnerabilities.
* The team communicates with the Kusama community and potential users to generate interest and support for the upcoming launch of Alpha Network.

#### June: Beta testing and community building

* The Alpha Network team launches a beta version of the network for testing and community feedback.
* The team actively engages with the community to build a strong user base and foster collaboration among developers and enthusiasts.

#### July: Launch

* The Alpha Network team launches the mainnet version of the network, allowing users to access the full range of features and functionalities.
* The team continues to monitor and improve the network, while also promoting it to potential users and developers.

Overall, this timeline provides a rough outline of the steps required to launch Alpha Network on the Kusama relaychain as a parachain. The actual timeline may vary depending on a range of factors, including the outcome of the Kusama parachain slot auction, the technical complexity of setting up the network, and the level of community interest and support.
