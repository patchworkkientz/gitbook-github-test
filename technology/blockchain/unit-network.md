# ðŸ”— Unit Network

## Overview

[Unit Network](https://explorer.unit.network/#/explorer) is a decentralised, web-based application and layer 1 blockchain built using the Substrate framework developed by [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and Parity Technologies. This means [Unit Network](https://explorer.unit.network/#/explorer) and it's blockchain the UnitChain are sovereign and do not rely on the exisiting layer 1 protocols like Ethereum, Solana and Cosmos to operate. We've built our own blockchain to specifically suit the purposes of [Unit Network](https://explorer.unit.network/#/explorer) and the token economy.

Unit Network embraces the tenets of neutrality and trust minimisation by offering a decentralised Web3 application accessible to anyone in the world. An economic infrastructure for the creation and management of DAOs and soon the mainstream adoption of the token economy.

At present [Unit Network](https://explorer.unit.network/#/explorer) is in beta / test-net phase but will soon deploy as a parachain on the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) relay chain.
