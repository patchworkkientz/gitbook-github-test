## Overview

Depositing your crypto to Unit Network can be done via the [Deposit](https://www.unit.network/wallet/deposit) tab of your user wallet.

If you do not already have crypto you can purchase Bitcoin with your debit / credit card through [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/) or any other exchange most suited to where you are located like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us). In the event you purchase from an exchange please read the warning below as you will first need to send to a private wallet before transferring to Unit Network.&#x20;

For users wishing to purchase over $250K USD please contact our sales team as we can assist with a smooth onramp through [Bitcoin Suisse](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/).

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important!** Do not send your crypto to Unit Network directly from a centralised exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) etc. The crypto must arrive from a self-custodial wallet like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) etc. so the transaction can be verified.&#x20;

This is quick and simple to do. We recommend [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) Wallet as it can hold nearly all cryptocurrencies.

For information on which networks to use when transferring your crypto to Unit Network and their respective block explorers please see the [Blue Chips](broken-reference) page. **Currently we only support native networks for deposits.** For example, if you are trying to deposit BTC you must do so via Native SegWit, not BEP20 or any others.
