## Overview

A [withdrawal](https://www.unit.network/wallet/withdraw) from Unit Network is **a transaction of transferring crypto from the Unit Network environment to an external address** (usually a wallet like Exodus or an exchange like Binance). As with all blockchain transactions - and contrary to sending tokens or crypto to another Unit Network  user - withdrawals are charged a 1% fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Currently users are only able to** [**withdraw**](https://www.unit.network/wallet/withdraw) **the** [**Blue Chip** ](broken-reference)**assets we support.** The UNIT token and all user generated tokens are _not_ interoperable with other crypto ecosystems until we roll out the self custodial wallets
{% endhint %}

It is also important to note that withdrawing requires the coins or tokens to be unwrapped which is facilitated by the [Vaults](exchange.md). Withdrawal requests go into a queue, and the Vaults compete to process withdrawals and earn fees. All [Vaults](exchange.md) can process a withdrawal/unwrapping.

## Fees

There is a 1% fee on withdrawals from Unit Network split equally two ways:

* 0.5% is sent to the UNIT treasury
* 0.5% is sent to the [Vault](exchange.md) who processes the withdrawal

## How to Withdraw
