# üöÄ $UNIT Token

## Overview

**UNIT** is a fixed supply utility token native to the [UnitChain](broken-reference), our layer one blockchain created with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) and purpose built to scale the token economy. As [UnitChain](broken-reference) is a sovereign blockchain, independent from other ecosystems like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/),  [Solana](https://solana.com/) and [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) the UNIT token currently can only be used within the [Unit Network](https://www.unit.network/) application. &#x20;

## Distribution Conditions

### **Sale Supply**

**The UNIT token is backed up by several cryptocurrencies like BTC. ETH, BNB etc. that buyers must use to purchase the token. The backing is created by locking 90% of all crypto raised through UNIT token sales into the UNIT treasury.**

1. This crypto provides immediate, transparent and real value to the UNIT token
2. The crypto can be redeemed by UNIT token holders at anytime if they burn their tokens&#x20;
3. UNIT becomes an index of the entire crypto economy while also growing in value by receiving 0.5% of every exchange on Unit Network

**A token with these fundamentals has never existed before.**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will UNIT be traded on other exchange platforms? </summary>

Yes the aim is to be listed on all major exchanges though a focus will be to grow use of the native exchange first as it directly supports the value of the UNIT token treasury and platform growth.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is UNIT an ERC20 token? </summary>

No, UNIT is native to the Unit Network platform and is currently not supported on other chains.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is UNIT more a commodity that will be used or equity in a company?</summary>

It‚Äôs a hybrid between a commodity/share, similar to BTC in the bitcoin network or ETH in the Ethereum network.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you value UNIT?</summary>

There is a "push" and a "pull" way to value the UNIT token:

a. Push. The current and expected future capital flowing into the UNIT treasury ‚Äúpushes‚Äù up the UNIT price like a ‚Äúdiscounted cash flow‚Äù because capital that flows in is like a dividend to UNIT holders and the treasury itself is a ‚Äúdividend-repository‚Äù accessible to token holders in a trustless way. Capital to the UNIT treasury comes from three sources:

i. Trading fees. 0.5% trading fee on millions and then billions of DAOs/tokens created across Unit Network to represent the value captured by an industry, city, business, brand, personal identity, idea, or anything else one can imagine. ii. Withdrawal fee. 0.5% fee is assessed on withdrawals from the platform. iii. Token sales. UNIT token sales, which bring deflationary capital onto the network and into the UNIT treasury, build a stronger and stronger sun-like center of gravitational pull around which the global token economy can revolve.

b. Pull. Circulating UNIT token has multiple uses that lock it up to create a supply shock and ‚Äúpull‚Äù the price up through the various sales rounds and bring in more capital to the UNIT treasury to back the token economy. i. Other Project Banks/Treasuries. UNIT can be used to buy into other project tokens, and much of that UNIT will go into treasuries and will stay there as long as the project token sports an above-book valuation (i.e. token owners believe it the project has a future). ii. Bond Staking. UNIT can be staked to earn bonding rewards, similar to DOT bonding rewards by DOT holders who stake DOT tokens on the Polkadot network iii. Vaults. UNIT can be locked by UNIT owners in vaults they create. Deposits to the network of BTC, ETH, DOT, etc. by other users are i. wrapped by these vaults to the Unit Network in a decentralized way as BTCU, ETHU, DOTU, etc., and ii. loans to vaults, whose UNIT is locked until the loan is completely repaid, making UNIT the pristine global reserve asset for the world‚Äôs ‚Äúdecentral bank‚Äù.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why are you raising funds?</summary>

To back the token economy. The more capital wrapped onto the network and into UNIT, city, and industry token treasuries, the stronger the gravitational pull for token projects to be created to want to earn UNIT and/or the respective city or industry tokens.
