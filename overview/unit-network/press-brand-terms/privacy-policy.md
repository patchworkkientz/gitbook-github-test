Our main priority is to make the platform 100% secure and easy to use for all clients and partners.&#x20;

Our goal is to keep the personal information we receive completely confidential at all times. While we do not forward or distribute your personal information outside of our organisation, we still have to tell you what we collect from you and how we use it. We may update this policy from time to time. Your continued use of all associated Unit Network sites indicates your agreement to the following terms.&#x20;

* To manage our relationship with customers, such as communicating with them about our goods and services, providing customer service, and notifying them of changes to our terms or privacy policy
* To administer and protect our business and services, including troubleshooting, and performing data analysis, testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data

* To use data analytics to debug, optimise, and improve our products and services, marketing, customer relationships and experiences

### What happens with your Personal Information?

For the purposes mentioned above, we may share your personal information with the following categories of business partners:

* Our Service Providers: We may share your personal information with our service providers for the purposes we outline above. For example, we may rely on service providers to host and maintain our online services, perform backup and storage services, process payments, transmit communications, and perform analytics services.&#x20;
* Government Agencies, Regulators and Professional Advisors: Where required by applicable law, we may also need to transfer your personal information to government agencies and regulators (e.g., tax authorities, courts, and government authorities).

We would like to specify that both we and our service providers currently process personal information on servers located in the Republic of Ireland and thus in the EU. We therefore abide by the rules and regulations established by the European Union, specifically, the GDPR. In connection hereto, you as a subject of data processing are entitled to the rights that the GDPR grants every individual located in the EU.

If you are a resident of California, our CCPA Privacy Policy applies to you. If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (collectively ‚ÄúEEA+‚Äù), our EEA+ Privacy Policy may apply.

You specifically have legal rights to access, update, review or demand deletion of   certain personal information as well as restrict or object to the use thereof. For your security, we may need to request specific information from you to verify your identity.

To review your personal information and/or to exercise your rights in accordance with the GDPR as well as in case of further questions, we encourage you to reach out to our Data Protection Officer, Alex Berstein, per email at: privacy(at)unit.network

### How do we Protect Personal Information?

We have put in place technological, physical and administrative procedures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information. In case of a suspected breach of personal information, we will notify you and any local regulator without a delay.

### **Unit LLC Supplemental CCPA Privacy Policy**

As mentioned in our other privacy disclosures, we don‚Äôt sell your personal information, but the privacy laws of California, including the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (‚ÄúCCPA‚Äù), require us to provide some information about our data processing practices to California residents.

If you are a resident of California and not part of our workforce, this Supplemental CCPA Privacy Policy applies to you. However, this Privacy Policy does not reflect our collection, use or disclosure of California residents‚Äô personal information where an exception under the CCPA applies.

### Your Personal Information: Right to Know, Request Deletion, and Opt-Out

As a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, and disclose about you specifically (‚Äúright to know‚Äù), and the right to ask that it be deleted. To submit a request to exercise the right to know or to delete, please submit a request, with the details you would like to know or delete, by email to privacy@Unit LLC and include ‚ÄúCalifornia Request to Know or Delete‚Äù in the subject line.

We may need to verify your identity, and/or ask you to confirm your request. If we deny your request, we will explain why.

You also have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by a business. We do not sell personal information, so there is no need to opt-out. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

### Right to non-discrimination for the exercise of Consumer‚Äôs Privacy Rights

You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment based on the exercise of your privacy rights under the CCPA.

### Right to be Informed of financial incentives

We do not currently offer any financial incentives in exchange for the retention or sale of California residents‚Äô personal information.

### Authorized Agent

You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf if your authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State of California, and you sign a written declaration that you authorize the authorized agent to act on your behalf.

If you use an authorized agent to submit a request under the CCPA, please have the authorized agent take the following steps in addition to the steps described in Section 1 above: (1) Email a notarized copy of your written declaration authorizing the agent to act on your behalf to the address listed below and (2) Provide any information we request from you to verify your identity and that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request under the CCPA on your behalf.

### What We Collect

We have set out in the _Privacy Policy_ the categories of personal information we have collected about California residents in the past 12 months as well as the sources, business or commercial purposes, and categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information. We collect this information directly from California residents who use our website or subscribe for our services. We may also collect some information about a California resident‚Äôs interests and preferences from a third-party source where they or their organization make such information publicly available, such as on their organization‚Äôs public website.

### **Unit LLC Supplemental EEA+ Privacy Notice**

If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (EEA+), and access our website, subscribe for Unit LLC services in your personal capacity, or use Unit LLC services as an authorized user of an organization that subscribes for Unit LLC services, this Supplemental EEA+ Privacy Notice applies to you.

As mentioned in our other privacy disclosures, we don‚Äôt sell your personal information, but the data protection laws of the EEA+, including the General Data Protection Regulation (‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù), require us to provide information about our data processing practices to certain people in the EEA+.

### Who Is the Data Controller?

The controller of data responsible for collection, processing and storage of your personal data is Unit LLC.&#x20;

### Why and how do we process Personal Data?

We minimize the amount of data collected from you to the minimum extent required by the business reasons and rely on the following legally defined goals for processing:

* collection of data necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (‚ÄúContract Performance‚Äù), to comply with an applicable legal obligation or to realize a legitimate interest based on an assessment of that interest and your privacy and other fundamental interests (‚ÄúLegitimate Interests‚Äù);
* acquisition of your consent (‚ÄúConsent‚Äù); and
* protection of your vital interests or those of another person (‚ÄúVital Interests‚Äù).

### **Policy with regard to Combatment of AML and Completion of KYC Proceedings**

**Unit Networks‚Äô Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer Policy (hereinafter - the ‚ÄúAML/KYC Policy‚Äù) is designated to prevent and mitigate possible risks of our company being involved in any kind of illegal activity.**

Both international and local regulations require us to implement effective internal procedures and mechanisms to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, corruption and bribery and to take action in case of any form of suspicious activity from our clients and partners.

AML/KYC Policy covers the following matters:

* Verification procedures
* Sanctions and PEP lists screening
* Monitoring Transactions

and consists of the following steps:

* Collecting Users‚Äô identification information&#x20;
* Establishing and updating internal policies and procedures for the completion, review, submission and retention of all reports and records required under the applicable laws and regulations&#x20;
* Monitoring transactions and investigating any significant deviations from normal activity&#x20;
* Implementing a records management system for appropriate storage and retrieval of documents, files, forms and logs&#x20;
* Updating risk assessment regularly&#x20;
* Providing law enforcement with information as required under the applicable laws and regulations.

One of the international standards for preventing illegal activity is customer due diligence. Unit LLC establishes its own verification procedures within the standards of anti-money laundering and ‚ÄúKnow Your Customer‚Äù frameworks.

Our identity verification procedure may require the individual to provide reliable, independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill). For such purposes we reserve the right to collect your identification information and to take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information reserving the right to investigate certain Users who have been determined to be risky or suspicious.

In addition, we reserve the right to request up-to-date documents, even though they have passed identity verification in the past.

The information will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the Privacy Policy and related regulations.

Once your identity has been verified, we will be able to avoid situations where our services are used to conduct illegal activities, which is why the KYC process is essential for our cooperation model.

In line with the international requirements, we have adopted a risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing ensuring measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing in relation to the identified risks.&#x20;

Hereby, we screen against recognised Sanctions Lists and Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists.&#x20;

For the screening purposes, we may - among other sources - use our service providers data integrated into the proprietary software.&#x20;

We also would like to emphasize that in case of possible suspicions of any illegal activities, we are entitled to terminate your account and all business transactions in connection hereto as well as to interact with law enforcement organizations reporting any kind of violations of the applicable legal regulations.
