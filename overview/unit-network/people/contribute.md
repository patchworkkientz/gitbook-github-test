# ðŸ‘· Contribute

## What it means to be a Contributor

All contributors are volunteers who actively contribute to our goal of building and maintaining the best community we can. Whether developers or non-technical enthusiasts, they are all driven by the same desire to actively contribute to the success of Unit Network and the token economy.

Please make sure to first familiarise yourself with the [Overview](broken-reference), [Unit Initiatives](../../ecosystem-daos/) & [Unit Network DAO](broken-reference) before you get started here. The process of becoming a contributor is designed to guide you toward ownership of an initiative that helps to accelerate progress of Unit Network and the token economy. &#x20;

Being a contributor means that you have access to work _in_ the Unit Network DAO, not _for_ the Unit Network DAO. _This is an important distinction to understand_. _What_ you work on, your level of dedication and how far youâ€™ll get all depends on **you**.

Cooperation Agreement

An outline of the cooperation agreement on Unit Network decentralized platform and DAO.&#x20;

## Overview

Unit Network is a decentralised platform and DAO that values collaboration, innovation, and self-sufficiency. We strive to create an environment where every contributor can thrive as we recognise that each individual has unique skills and perspectives to offer.

To foster a sense of community and ensure that all contributors are treated fairly, we have created a Contributor Cooperation Agreement. This agreement outlines the expectations and responsibilities of all contributors to the Unit Network ecosystem.

#### **Key elements of the Contributor Cooperation Agreement include:**

1. **Duties:** We expect all contributors to actively contribute to the growth and development of the ecosystem. This may include tasks such as developing initiatives, creating content, providing feedback, and participating in community events.
2. **Core Values:** All contributions to the ecosystem must be properly attributed to the contributor. This ensures that contributors are recognised for their work and allows others to build on their contributions.
3. **Licensing:** All contributions to the ecosystem must be made under an open source license. This ensures that the community can benefit from the contributions and that the ecosystem remains open and transparent.
4. **Conflict Resolution:** In the event of any conflicts or disputes, we encourage all parties to work together to find a resolution. This may involve mediation or other forms of conflict resolution.
5. **Contributor Benefits:** As a decentralised platform, we do not provide monetary compensation for contributions. However, we do offer a range of incentives and rewards to contributors, such as access to exclusive events, recognition in the community, and the opportunity to earn tokens through participation in the ecosystem.
6. **Off-boarding:** If an individual decides to leave their role with Unit Network, it is important to ensure a smooth transition to protect the DAO's assets and information. The off-boarding process helps the team to collect all the necessary information from the departing contributor and ensure all loose ends are tied up.

## 1. Duties

#### **Every contributor has general responsibilities such as:**&#x20;

* Familiarise yourself with the mission, vision, and goals of Unit Network
* Be a local representative of Unit Network (Maintain and grow City & Industry tokens)
* Help build and maintain a positive image of Unit Network brand at all times
* Contribute ideas and participate in Unit meetings to explore new projects, strategies, and initiatives:
* Regular attendance to daily core team meetings
* Frequent interaction within the chats/groups on telegram
* Grow the Unit Network community by inviting and welcoming new community members
* Scope, propose, and deliver 1 initiative / project that helps advance Unit Network with an alignment from the strategy team within a period of 3 month, and deliver progress report by the end of this period
* Be accountable and update all documentation, tasks/project progress reports on a timely basis in order to maintain the high level of transparency within the team and existing workloads
* Autonomous organisation and governance: self-propose, organise and lead initiatives
* Have an open-source mindset (build and innovate on top of what already exists)
* Bring an entrepreneurship mindset (ownership of overall success and growth of Unit Network ecosystem)
* Other duties as assigned

## 2. Core Values

#### **Every contributor has a general responsibilities such as:**

* **Individual sovereignty:** We believe in empowering individuals to take control of their own financial lives and personal identities through the use of blockchain technology.
* **Self-sufficiency:** We encourage all contributors to take initiative and guide themselves on tasks and projects, while still collaborating with others and seeking help when needed.
* **Problem-solving mentality:** We value proactive problem-solving and encourage all contributors to identify and document areas for improvement, and work together to implement solutions.
* **Collaboration and teamwork:** We believe in the strength of collaboration and teamwork, and encourage all contributors to connect with their peers to discuss and collaborate on challenges.
* **The token economy:** Our ultimate goal is to create a self-sustaining and continually growing token economy that adds value to the larger blockchain ecosystem, and rewards all contributors for their contributions.

As the blockchain industry is fast-paced and we all have to adopt to ever-changing conditions, we want to encourage you to take the initiative and take over responsibilities, pick tasks and create your own network within the network.

_As we work remotely and independently on a common goal, it is highly important to act responsibly and interact respectfully with each other. Please cultivate a proactive work culture and open mindset._&#x20;

## 3. Licensing

All contributions made to the ecosystem must be done so under an open-source license.&#x20;

This requirement ensures that the community can benefit from the contributions and that the ecosystem remains open and transparent. By using open-source licenses, contributors are allowing others to access, use, and build upon their contributions, without the risk of copyright infringement.&#x20;

This point also promotes collaboration and community-driven development, as it enables other contributors to build on existing work and create innovative solutions together. The Licensing point is essential to the overall ethos of the ecosystem, which values transparency, openness, and accessibility.

## 4. **Conflict Resolution**

At Unit Network DAO, we strive to maintain a positive and collaborative environment among all contributors. However, conflicts may arise from time to time, and it's important to address them in a timely and respectful manner. We encourage all contributors to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve conflicts, and we have a conflict resolution process in place to facilitate this.

**Conflict Resolution Process:**

1. **Identify the issue:** Any contributor who experiences or witnesses a conflict should bring it to the attention of the other party/parties involved as soon as possible.
2. **Discuss the issue:** The parties involved should schedule a time to have a face-to-face or virtual meeting to discuss the issue. They should approach the discussion with an open mind and a willingness to listen to each other's perspectives.
3. **Seek mediation:** If the parties are unable to resolve the conflict on their own, they can seek the help of a mediator. The mediator will be a neutral third party who can facilitate the discussion and help the parties find a mutually acceptable solution.
4. **Escalate the issue:** If the conflict cannot be resolved through mediation, the parties may escalate the issue to the Core Team for further discussion and resolution.
5. **Review the situation:** After the conflict is resolved, the parties involved should review the situation to identify what caused the conflict and how to prevent it from happening again in the future.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** If the conflict involves a violation of the Contributor Cooperation Agreement or other policies, the Core Team may take appropriate action, which may include off-boarding the contributor in question.
{% endhint %}

## 6. Off-boarding

If an individual decides to leave, or is asked to leave their role with Unit Network, it is important to ensure a smooth transition to protect the DAO's assets and information. The off-boarding process helps us to collect all the necessary information from the departing contributor.

**Voluntary Off-boarding Process:**

1. **Exit Notice:** The contributor must give notice of their intention to leave the company. This can be done through an email to their supervisor.
2. **Data Backup:** The contributor must backup all necessary data and information that they were working on and hand over to the supervisor.
3. **Accounts Closure:** All work-related accounts such as email, cloud storage, social media, and other company-related accounts will be archived and deactivated by the core team.

**Involuntary Off-boarding Process:**

For the sake of transparency and fairness, the Core Team believes that all contributors need to be made aware that they can be removed from the project for consistent disruption, lack of attendance / contribution and negatively impacting Unit Network's progress.&#x20;

We understand that this may not align with the common practice of a DAO, but we believe that it is important to establish clear rules and consequences to ensure the smooth operation and progress of the community.

Involuntary off-boarding for contributors who consistently break rules and disrupt the progress of the DAO will be carried out in a fair and objective manner. Below is the process:

1. **Notification:** The contributor in question will be notified that their behaviour is not in line with the core values and rules of the DAO. This notification will include specific examples of the behaviour in question and a clear explanation of how it has been detrimental to the DAO's progress.
2. **Warning:** The contributor will be given a warning and a specific time frame during which they are expected to rectify their behaviour.
3. **Final Decision:** If the contributor still does not rectify their behaviour, the DAO will make a final decision about the contributor's involvement. This decision may include suspension or termination of their involvement with the DAO.
4. **Communication:** The decision will be communicated to the contributor in question as well as to the rest of the DAO community.
