# ðŸŽ— Community

## Overview

At Unit Network, we champion inclusion and access for everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical ability, religion, ethnicity, and perspective.

The chats are public spaces, so please be mindful of language, and continue any personal issues in a private message or off of the platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is strictly forbidden to ask people for crypto/deposits within Unit Network chats. If anyone, including a person pretending to be a Unit team member, requests anything from you, please let us know and we will remove and block that person. As you know, there are scammers everywhere, pretending to be people they are not, so be mindful of the TG handles and notify an admin.
