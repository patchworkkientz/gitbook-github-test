## **Overview:**&#x20;

A [blue chip](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) refers to an established, stable, and well recognised cryptocurrency. [Blue chips](broken-reference) are characterised by a **high market capitalisation**, listings on a **major exchanges**, and a history of reliable growth and community engagement**, although we do not directly endorse any coins or tokens as investments.**

While crypto is still in its early stages of development we believe it's important to offer a spread of blue chip cryptocurrencies to improve adoption and optionality for users while ensuring the UNIT Treasury has a solid backing moving forward.

{% hint style="info" %}
More coins and tokens will be added over time as requested by the community while we work on a system that will allow any user to add any non-native coin or token to the ecosystem that is live and on-chain. This will relate to the [Vaults so be sure to keep an eye out here.](../../technology/key-features/wallet/exchange.md)
