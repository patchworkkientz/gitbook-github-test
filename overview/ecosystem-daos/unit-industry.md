## Overview:

Each Industry Token is an open [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_autonomous\_organization) consisting of individuals, businesses and communities within the industry while also being a form of currency backed by the [Blue Chips](broken-reference) and a reverse ETF, allowing anyone to buy a single token and share in the upside of a specific territory.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All [Industry Tokens](https://www.unit.network/explore?tab=industry) have been created by [Unit Foundation](https://www.unit.network/user/unitfoundation)  Please be sure to check the token managers username on the Tokens Info page to avoid fraudulent tokens.

## Governance

All Unit Network core team are part of at least one Industry Token DAO to assist with setup, management and ensure there is a direct channel communication with the community. &#x20;

Industry Token bank and treasury management will ultimately handed off to the various core team members that work to build and moderate the Industry Token communities so that governance and objectives can be tailored to suit.&#x20;

## Reserve Assets

Just like the [UNIT Coin](broken-reference) all the [Industry Tokens](https://www.unit.network/explore?tab=industry) issued by [Unit Foundation](https://www.unit.network/user/unitfoundation) are backed by the [Blue Chips](broken-reference) with 90% of all [Industry Tokens](https://www.unit.network/explore?tab=industry) sales getting locked into the [treasury](broken-reference) to support value and minimise downside risk.&#x20;

Additionally, [Industry Token](unit-industry.md#industry-tokens) Treasuries receive 0.5% of all [Industry Token](unit-industry.md#industry-tokens) trades.

## Industry Token FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why city and industry tokens?</summary>

Cities and industries are forms of communities that we all share. City and industry tokens, with diversified digital stores of value backing their treasuries, will attract people in those cities and industries to want to earn and share ownership in communities they already share with like-minded individuals, but the technology was not available previously to easily organise and gather.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are city and industry tokens issued?</summary>

Each city and industry token has 100m maximum supply, issued from its bank at progressively higher prices, as the TOKEN-USDU exchange price reaches the next prescribed bank price and the token becomes attractive to buy.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are city and industry tokens valued?</summary>

There is a ‚Äúpush‚Äù and ‚Äúpull‚Äù way to value a city or industry token. The limited supply issued at any one time is used to purchase project, personal, or business tokens in that community and is sequestered in those token banks and treasuries, pulling up a token‚Äôs price through the various sale price rounds, issuing more of the token to the market.

In addition, a 0.5% fee is taken on a token‚Äôs trades on its TOKEN-USDU exchange, pushing up the floor value of the city/industry token and justifying its trading price and market cap on an ‚Äúearnings‚Äù or ‚Äúbook value‚Äù basis.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What am I buying if I buy a city or industry token?</summary>

You are buying essentially a reverse ETF ‚Äì a stake in that city‚Äôs or industry‚Äôs token economy of the future ‚Äì not through the mayor‚Äôs office or obliquely through an exchange traded fund of relatively large publicly traded stocks in that industry, but directly owning a portion of the ‚Äúshared bank account‚Äù represented by that token community, made possible by Unit‚Äôs technology.

Happens in two ways:

1. Community members and businesses buy into it; as ownership in the ecosystem
2. businesses/projects use it as a reserve asset

where its value is backed by exchange fees along with the underlying asset it holds.

Say 1m musicians buy into the MUSIC token, it operates like a shared fund/savings account, given the 100m limited supply; this will tend to drive the price/value of it upwards.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a ‚Äúreverse-ETF‚Äù?</summary>

An ETF (exchange-traded fund) holds assets on behalf of shareholders in the fund.

A token/reverse-ETF is itself invested in other token banks/treasuries. Sequestering the limited-supply reverse ETF/token in project token treasuries

1. pulls up the price of the reverse ETF and represents a one-token way to buy that class of assets, while
2. The trading fees and bank token sales raise the floor price, which pushes up the value
3. Can all industries be tokenized? Do you have examples of tokenized industries/projects?

Industries that are big enough in terms of transaction activities and population are the main focus in Unit. All tokens are fungible within the industry or city.

1. Let‚Äôs say a musician in New York creates a new token - will that token eventually be part of the NY city community page - or how would someone find that opportunity if they didn't know the name of the particular token to search for?

Yes, the tokens will be searchable by community, price/treasury, price/treasury growth rate, by timed upcoming sales rounds, and other metrics.
