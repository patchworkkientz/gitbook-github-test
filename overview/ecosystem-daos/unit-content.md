We all observed how the importance of a good **social media presence** has increased in the last few years, which makes it one of the **strongest marketing tools** for companies and individuals. We believe that the importance will continue to rise so that there will be no successful company or brand without a good social media presence. The Unit Network $CONTENT DAO will play a major role in making that happen.
