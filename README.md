## Introduction

**Unit Network is a no-code application that allows you to create new communities, new companies and new currencies. It is the unification of transparent finance, individual sovereignty and peer-to-peer commerce creating a turnkey solution for global inequity, what we call the token economy.**

Launching on Polkadotâ€™s multi-chain architecture, Unit Network's easy-to-use token-building tools warrant anyone to seamlessly create and manage a digital token ecosystem to represent the value of an industry, city, business, brand, personal identity, idea, or anything else one can imagine. Unit Network enables this IP to become extremely liquid / tradable on a decentralised application accessible to anyone in the world.&#x20;

While it might sound lofty, at Unit Network we're focused on solving wealth inequity by creating a token economy that completely changes the role of money in society, the way the internet did for information and smartphones for mobile communication.

## Long-term Vision

1. Unit Network becomes the most adopted token creator, marketplace and decentralised exchange
2. Unit Network DAO grows to 200 core team members globally, governed by the UNIT token and highly decentralised on a protocol and operational level
3. The primary goal is to build powerful and accessible DeFi products that allow anyone in the world to build and manage a token economy.
4. Tokenisation scales horizontally, anyone in the world can connect a real-world-business to the Unit Network ecosystem and build new communities, new companies and new currencies backed by real value.
5. Unit Network open-sources all code, contribution and management. With time the core team and product development will completely decentralise.&#x20;

## Guiding Principles of Unit Network

1. **Decentralisation:** The infrastructure should be decentralised, with no single entity controlling the network or dictating the rules. This ensures that the community has full control over the platform and their assets.
2. **Transparency:** Transactions and interactions should be immutable and transparent, so that everyone can verify and track ownership of assets on the network.
3. **Open Source:** The platform should be open source, allowing for anyone to participate in the development of the network and ensuring transparency.
4. **Community Driven:** The platform should be driven by the community, with decisions made through consensus and democratic processes.
5. **Financial Freedom:** The platform should promote financial freedom, allowing individuals to own and manage their assets without any restrictions.
6. **Interoperability:** The platform should be interoperable, allowing for seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks.
7. **Scalability:** The infrastructure should be scalable, able to handle high volumes of transactions without compromising the security or integrity of the network.
8. **Incentivisation:** The platform should incentivise participation and contribution to the network, rewarding those who help to maintain the integrity of the blockchain.
9. **Privacy:** The platform should prioritise privacy, allowing users to transact anonymously if they choose to do so.
10. **Education and Accessibility:** The platform should prioritise education and accessibility, making it easy for anyone to participate and understand the technology behind the blockchain.
